                        <!--<p>The Hate U Give is a 2017 young adult novel by Angie Thomas. 
                            It is Thomas's debut novel, expanded from a short story she wrote in college in reaction to the police shooting of Oscar Grant. 
                            The book is narrated by Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black girl from a poor neighborhood who attends an elite private school in a predominantly white, affluent part of the city. 
                            Starr becomes entangled in a national news story after she witnesses a white police officer shoot and kill her childhood friend, Khalil. 
                            She speaks up about the shooting in increasingly public ways, and social tensions culminate in a riot after a grand jury decides not to indict the police officer for the shooting.</p> -->
